# Defensive programming

It's a form of defensive design intended to develop programs that are capable of detecting potential security anomalies and make predetermined responses. It ensures the continuing function of a piece of software under unforeseen circumstances. These practices are often used where high availability, safety, or security is needed. *(source: Wikipedia)*

The final goal is to improve software and source code, in terms of:

+ Quality, reducing the number of software bugs and problems
+ Readability
+ Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions.

Overly defensive programming, however, may safeguard against errors that will never be encountered, thus incurring run-time and maintenance costs.
