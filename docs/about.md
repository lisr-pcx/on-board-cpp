# About

*(kind of)* Embedded Software Developer.  
In the last 6 years I worked as software consultant (EU market) on railway onboard/signalling devices, developing solutions in ADA and C++ language mainly on legacy codebases.

There are tons of good sites and opensource projects on the web.  
Be curios, try stuff, stay humble.

Have fun!
