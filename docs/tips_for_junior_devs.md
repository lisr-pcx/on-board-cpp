# Tips for Junior Developers

Being a young developer working in a team can be quite challenging and sometimes a lot of the pressure is put not only on tech related topics but also on social relationship.

> Do the Right Things Right!

## How to

**Focus**  
Context switching comes at the cost of low developer productivity, reduced focus time, and high cognitive residue, all impacting the code quality and final product delivery.
Few suggestions:

+ Disable phone and chat notifications
+ Set specific time-block only for coding
+ Plan your daily tasks
+ Less coffee, more sleep

**IDE and Tools**  
Learn how to use them, their workflow, and the most used key shortcuts.

**Do not repeat yourselif (DRY)**  
Learn a scripting language (Python, BASH ...) and make all repetive task executables via single command.
Be reasonable about the time spent coding the scripts. 

**Feedbacks**  
Ask for feedbacks! Receive them a lot, they will help you to be a better developer (and also give them).

**Documentation**  
When writing notes be simple, clear and effective (i.e. what to modify, where to apply these changes, why matters). 

## Work Environment

Top five reason that make developers unhappy of their job:

1. Being stuck in problem solving
2. Time pressure
3. Bad code quality and coding practice
4. Under-performing colleague
5. Feeling inadegate with work

Don't be unhappy, find a way to cope with these things. Ask to your mentor for tips!
