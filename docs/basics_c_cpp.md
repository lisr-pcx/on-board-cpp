# Basics

> Before start just get a *quick bite* of the topic.

This tip is valid for any kind of technology, feature, framework .. at beginning you just want some highlights and try some live examples when available. Videos and articles are a good source of information. At this stage do not be afraid to jump from link to link.

After that it's time to acquire some core concepts and build simple stuff.

Essentially there are three different ways for learning:

1. **Books and Docs**: gradually discover chapter by chapter, guided by authors
2. **Videos (lessons, seminaries)**: concepts are explained putting more emphasis on schemes, flowcharts, ... and live examples
3. **Doing (small project, tutorial)**: try to build up something, gettin the knownledge on your specific needs (learn by mistakes)

Choose your preferred path or mix them according to your goal.  
Some people are confortable gettin the theory first, and then process all the information before start coding. Other people instead go straight to the action "hammering the code" until they get some results, and then they explore all the concepts and layers behind.

I suggest to setup your dev enviroinment (IDE, editor, toolchain...) and try the code snippets proposed time to time. A good balance between theory and practice is the key.

Give yourself some time in between the arguments, sometimes it's good to keep a slower pace.

I found the websites "ByExample" quite effective because they give you the classic index of topics to acquire.  
Only a small snippet of code is showed, forcing the reader to actively retrieve via other sources the theory behind.

## Books and documentation

## Video lessons

## Small projects and tutorials

"Learn by doing" is good philosophy, anyway make sure to know some basic stuffs or it could became a mere "copy and paste" routine.
