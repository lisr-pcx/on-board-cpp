A *personal* collection of resources, links, notes, and training materials.

    Work in progress, last update: January 2024


## Start

Get a **quick overview** of the topic in order to get some *core* concepts, use cases. This is a general tip, valid also for any kind of technology, feature, framework .. at this stage you just want a bite of the argument, and eventually try live examples (if available).

Videos and articles are a good source of information.
