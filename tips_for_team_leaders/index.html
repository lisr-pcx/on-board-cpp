    <h1 id="tips-for-team-leaders">Tips for Team Leaders</h1>
<p>If you’re guiding a team of people towards an end goal, you’re a team leader.</p>
<p>Team leaders are responsible for everything from day-to-day operations to ensuring that their team members are best supported to achieve their goals.<br />
They provide guidance and instructions to a working group about a single or a portfolio of projects. They are in charge of delegating work, overseeing progress and coaching/mentorship team members as needed.</p>
<p>Team Leads responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing work</li>
<li>Communication (give context)</li>
<li>Delegating</li>
<li><a href="https://asana.com/resources/lead-by-example">Leading by example</a></li>
<li><a href="https://asana.com/resources/resource-allocation">Allocating and managing resources</a></li>
<li>Problem solving</li>
<li>Managing project progress and reporting to stakeholders</li>
<li>Coaching to improve team member skill sets and identifying areas for improvement</li>
<li>Motivating team members to accomplish their goals</li>
<li>Representing and advocating for team needs</li>
</ul>
<p>During transition from Dev to Tech-Lead be aware about your new duties and <strong>avoid these common errors</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing code all the time - <em>You have also coordination and management task to do for the team, not just coding</em></li>
<li>Making all the technical decisions - <em>Leave some challenges to your team, use their know-how</em></li>
<li>Do not care about people - <em>Be aware about personal issue and feelings</em></li>
<li>Assume that team know what they are doing - <em>Take some time to share scopes, goal, direction with all the team members</em></li>
<li>Ignore arguments and conflicts - <em>Do not avoid difficult conversations</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Before accepting the role have a honest talk with the company management about what they expect from you (goals/duties) and what is your vision and your expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s about making good software with a team.<br />
<em>Eryn O’Neil</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="be-prepared">Be prepared</h2>
<p>For this kind of role you'll need to develop some skills:</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong><br />
Good team leaders provide context, so team members understand why their work matters and how their work fits into the larger company vision.<br />
With that context, developers can more effectively prioritize tasks and ensure they deliver quality work at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>Moving work forward</strong><br />
Once your team understands what goals they’re supporting, they also need a clear way to visualize how they’re going to get there.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong><br />
Verbal and nonverbal communication (in fact, a lot of communication comes through body language and facial expressions).<br />
Learn how to translate tech topics into real world example for non tech people.<br />
Your are going to write a lot of reports and exchange info with business units, it's better to learn basic financial management (ask to your manager how their spreadsheets works).</p>
<p><strong>Organization</strong><br />
Your team needs to be able to count on you and trust that you have everything under control.</p>
<p><strong>Delegating</strong><br />
To delegate effectively, you must first understand each team member’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests.    <br />
Keep in mind that the team members may do things differently than you would have. Part of delegating is learning to let go and give your team members the reins.    <br />
At last: ”Trust, but verify”  </p>
<p><strong>Problem-Solving</strong><br />
If you’re new to problem solving, try answering the following questions:    <br />
How is the team going to approach the work?<br />
What’s most important?<br />
What do they have to focus on?<br />
How will this decision impact the team?  </p>
<p><strong>Time management</strong><br />
Team leaders are masters on that, they have a great sense of how to prioritize work.<br />
Be aware that context-switching is a proven drag on productivity. <br />
Plan carefully your agenda and make sure to have some slot without meetings in order to do your stuff.  </p>
<p><strong>Workload management</strong>    <br />
You’re ultimately responsible for helping your team accomplish their goals.<br />
Track progress and make sure no one is getting close to burnout.  </p>
<p><strong>Team building</strong><br />
Make sure everyone feels like part of the team, evaluate team performance and cheer your team members on.<br />
Be honest, be fair, practice empathy.  </p>
<p><strong>Mentoring and coaching</strong><br />
A big part of a team leader’s role is to provide coaching, training, and mentoring where applicable.<br />
Ask everytime for feedbacks but also give them. Identify communication channels and ways to promote these exchanges and growth.<br />
Lead by example. Be the developer you wanna work with.  </p>
<h2 id="mastering-in-three-steps">Mastering in three steps</h2>
<p>Achieve tech lead mastery by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Facilitate</strong>. Help your team do their jobs</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove roadblocks</li>
<li>Perceive the need</li>
<li>Know the answers or where to find them</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advocate</strong>. Keep the big picture in mind</p>
<ol>
<li>Advocate for your project: sometimes you have to say no</li>
<li>Say no + always explain why</li>
<li>Say no + but ... (if you are talking to managers)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motivate</strong>. Guide your team to the best possible result</p>
<ol>
<li>Your attitude is important. When complaining you’re not finding a solution.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that teams are not immutable: adding people in a team change cultural values, relationships, … it becames a new team. Think about it when hiring!<br />
Also people who leave the team for a certain amount of time (sick leave, newborn, temporary moved …) modify the identity and roles inside.</p>

<h2 id="errors-and-lessons-learned">Errors and lessons learned</h2>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>Define and apply a process for your team. You’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent onboarding and documentation</li>
<li>Ongoing internal training</li>
<li>Frequent code reviews and coaching</li>
<li>Comprehensive test suites</li>
<li>Consistent style and quality guidelines</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="keep-track">Keep track</h3>
<p>Be open, discuss everything, have meetings… but always write down the facts and share it to eveyone involved (just in case when things go wrong).</p>
<h3 id="avoid-the-rockstar-developers">Avoid the “Rockstar-Developers”</h3>
<p>They become bottlenecks (when on holiday, away, assigned to another project…).</p>
<p>They create dependent teams (other members stop looking for answers/thinking and just wait the rockstart point of view)</p>
<p>They build knowledge silos (no shared information, full know-how to a single person)</p>
<p>They eventually leave... Every team member must be interchangeable on the roles, or at least with a lower impact on delivery.</p>
<h3 id="train-junior-developers">Train junior developers</h3>
<p>Create an onboard program to smooth the learning curve for new team members.</p>
<p>Follow these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a plan</li>
<li>Spend time with the trainee (pair programming)</li>
<li>Give <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>relevant</strong> feedbacks and share your experience</li>
<li>Give opportunity to deliberate practice</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="few-more-concepts">Few more concepts</h2>
<h3 id="smart">SMART</h3>
<p>SMART allow you to write goals that are clear, attainable and meaningful.<br />
Having clarity in your goal-setting provides the motivation and focus you need to be successful.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S</strong>pecific (simple, sensible, significant)</li>
<li><strong>M</strong>easurable (meaningful, motivating)</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>chievable (agreed, attainable)</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>elevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based)</li>
<li><strong>T</strong>ime bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-google-project-aristotle">The Google Project Aristotle</h2>
<p>The researchers found (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html">read</a>) that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together. In order of importance:</p>
<p><strong>Psychological safety</strong> (<a href="https://youtu.be/LhoLuui9gX8">video</a>)<br />
Team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other<br />
<em>“If I make a mistake on our team, it is not held against me.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Dependability</strong><br />
Team members get things done on time and meet Google’s high bar for excellence
<em>“When my teammates say they’ll do something, they follow through with it.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Structure and clarity</strong>
Team members have clear roles, plans and goals
<em>“Our team has an effective decision-making process.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong><br />
Work is personally important to team members
<em>“The work I do for our team is meaningful to me.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong><br />
Team members think their work matters and creates change
<em>“I understand how our team’s work contributes to the organization's goals.”</em></p>
<p>The researchers also discovered which variables were not significantly connected with team effectiveness at Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collocation of teammates (sitting together in the same office)</li>
<li>Consensus-driven decision making</li>
<li>Extroversion of team members</li>
<li>Individual performance of team members</li>
<li>Workload size</li>
<li>Seniority</li>
<li>Team size</li>
<li>Tenure</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note though that while these variables did not significantly impact team effectiveness measurements at Google, that doesn’t mean they’re not important elsewhere.</p>
