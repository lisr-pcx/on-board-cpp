At the same time you don't want to clone another repo or worst to loose your current sourcecode. The git stash command can help you, temporary storing your code changes. Then they can be retrieved any time in the future. Please read here . Files management There are some files you may want Git to ignore and not track in your repository. These include many that are auto-generated (by IDE) or platform-specific, as well as other local configuration files or compiled code (.elf .exe .bin). To do that create a hidden file name \".gitignore\" and edit putting inside all folders and name files that you want to ignore. Please note that multiple .gitgnore files can be created inside each project folder for better filter granularity.

Use them in your C/C++ code but also inside scripts (Python) or directly in your editor (vi or notepad++). Overview A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp ) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-search algorithms for: find and find-replace operations input validation log analysis Most programming languages support regex either natively or via libraries. A regex pattern matches a target string . The pattern is composed by a sequence of atoms . An atom is a single point within the regex pattern which it tries to match to the target string. A match is made, not when all the atoms of the string are matched, but rather when all the pattern atoms in the regex have matched. The idea is to make a small pattern of characters stand for a large number of possible strings, rather than compiling a large list of all the literal possibilities. Syntax Depending on the regex processor there are about fourteen metacharacters, characters that may or may not have their literal character meaning, depending on context, or whether they are \"escaped\", i.e. preceded by an escape sequence, in this case, the backslash \\ . Examples .at matches any three-character string ending with \"at\", including \"hat\", \"cat\", \"bat\", \"4at\", \"#at\" and \" at\" (starting with a space). [hc]at matches \"hat\" and \"cat\". [^b]at matches all strings matched by .at except \"bat\". [^hc]at matches all strings matched by .at other than \"hat\" and \"cat\". ^[hc]at matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the beginning of the string or line. [hc]at$ matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the end of the string or line. \\[.\\] matches any single character surrounded by \"[\" and \"]\" since the brackets are escaped, for example: \"[a]\", \"[b]\", \"[7]\", \"[@]\", \"[]]\", and \"[ ]\" (bracket space bracket). s.* matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: \"s\", \"saw\", \"seed\", \"s3w96.7\".

Usually such patterns are used by string-search algorithms for: find and find-replace operations input validation log analysis Most programming languages support regex either natively or via libraries. A regex pattern matches a target string . The pattern is composed by a sequence of atoms . An atom is a single point within the regex pattern which it tries to match to the target string. A match is made, not when all the atoms of the string are matched, but rather when all the pattern atoms in the regex have matched. The idea is to make a small pattern of characters stand for a large number of possible strings, rather than compiling a large list of all the literal possibilities.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"regular_expressions/#syntax","text":"Depending on the regex processor there are about fourteen metacharacters, characters that may or may not have their literal character meaning, depending on context, or whether they are \"escaped\", i.e. preceded by an escape sequence, in this case, the backslash \\ .","title":"Syntax"},{"location":"regular_expressions/#examples","text":".at matches any three-character string ending with \"at\", including \"hat\", \"cat\", \"bat\", \"4at\", \"#at\" and \" at\" (starting with a space).

Team leaders are responsible for everything from day-to-day operations to ensuring that their team members are best supported to achieve their goals. They provide guidance and instructions to a working group about a single or a portfolio of projects. They are in charge of delegating work, overseeing progress and coaching/mentorship team members as needed. Team Leads responsibilities include: Organizing work Communication (give context) Delegating Leading by example Allocating and managing resources Problem solving Managing project progress and reporting to stakeholders Coaching to improve team member skill sets and identifying areas for improvement Motivating team members to accomplish their goals Representing and advocating for team needs Transition to Lead-Role During transition from Dev to Tech-Lead be aware about your new duties and avoid these common errors : Writing code all the time - You have also coordination and management task to do for the team, not just coding Making all the technical decisions - Leave some challenges to your team, use their know-how Do not care about people - Be aware about personal issue and feelings Assume that team know what they are doing - Take some time to share scopes, goal, direction with all the team members Ignore arguments and conflicts - Do not avoid difficult conversations Before accepting the role have a honest talk with the company management about what they expect from you (goals/duties) and what is your vision and your expectations. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about making good software with a team. Eryn O\u2019Neil Be prepared For this kind of role you'll need to develop some skills: Give context Good team leaders provide context, so team members understand why their work matters and how their work fits into the larger company vision. With that context, developers can more effectively prioritize tasks and ensure they deliver quality work at the right time. Moving work forward Once your team understands what goals they\u2019re supporting, they also need a clear way to visualize how they\u2019re going to get there. Clear communication Verbal and nonverbal (body language, facial expression ..) communication are very important for this role, people listen your words and look at you for a lot of reasons (help, guidance, confirmation ..). Learn how to translate tech topics and issue into real world example for non tech people. Simplify but still get to the point. Writing reports and exchange info with business units it's part of the role, it's better to learn basic financial management, find a common ground (and ask to your manager how their spreadsheets works). Organization Your team needs to be able to count on you and trust that you have everything under control. Delegating To delegate effectively, you must first understand each team member\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Keep in mind that the team members may do things differently than you would have. Part of delegating is learning to let go and give your team members the reins. Do not forget: \u201dTrust, but verify.\u201d Problem-Solving If you\u2019re new to problem solving, try answering the following questions: How is the team going to approach the work? What\u2019s most important? What do they have to focus on? How will this decision impact the team? Time management Team leaders are masters on that, they have a great sense of how to prioritize work. Be aware that context-switching is a proven drag on productivity. Plan carefully your agenda and make sure to have some time slot without meetings in order to do your stuff. Workload management You\u2019re ultimately responsible for helping your team accomplish their goals. Track the progress and make sure no one is getting close to burnout. Team building Make sure everyone feels like part of the team, evaluate team performance and cheer your team members on. Be honest, be fair, practice empathy. Mentoring and coaching A big part of a team leader\u2019s role is to provide coaching, training, and mentoring where applicable. Ask everytime for feedbacks but also give them. Identify communication channels and ways to promote these exchanges and growth. Remember: \"Lead by example.
